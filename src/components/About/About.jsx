            Hello, Iâ€™m Matthew Peldunas, a passionate Web Developer from New Jersey. 
            I started my journey into web development at TripleTen, where I not only 
            discovered my passion for coding but also developed a solid foundation in various technologies. 
            In the program, I learned how to code in HTML and CSS formats and eventually progressed into more
            advanced areas such as JavaScript, React, Node, and Express. I also
            became proficient in Git, which has been helpful for managing and
            collaborating on various projects within the program. I enjoyed my time at TripleTen,
            where I aquired new skills and the confidence to handle a wide range of
            challenges. As a recent graduate, I am ready to take ona fulfilling and successful career!
